          <h2>What are calories?</h2>
          <p>
            Calories represent energy derived from food and drinks, crucial for
            bodily functions. Daily intake averages 2,000 calories to maintain
            weight, influenced by age, gender, and health.
          </p>

          <h2>What is your Goal?</h2>

          <h2>1- Weight Loss</h2>
          <p>
            To lose weight effectively, maintain a calorie deficit by consuming
            fewer calories than expended. A deficit of 500 to 1,000 calories
            daily yields sustainable weight loss of 1 to 2 pounds weekly.
            However, excessively reducing calories may slow metabolism and lead
            to muscle loss. Individual calorie needs vary based on factors like
            age, gender, weight, height, and activity level, necessitating
            personalized guidance from a healthcare professional for a healthy
            eating plan.
          </p>

          <h2>2- Gain Weight</h2>
          <p>
            To gain weight healthily, consume more calories than expended, known
            as a calorie surplus. Add 500 to 1,000 calories daily with
            nutrient-rich foods like lean proteins and whole grains. Incorporate
            strength training to build muscle mass gradually. Avoid excessive
            consumption of unhealthy foods high in added sugars and saturated
            fats, seeking guidance from healthcare professionals or dietitians
            for personalized advice.
